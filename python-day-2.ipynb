This tool will help you track expenses, categorize them, and generate basic statistical summaries.\n\nThis tool should allow users to:\n\n1. Input expense data,\n2. Generate summaries and reports, and\n3. Save and load data from files.\n\nIn order for us to build it, we need to know how each of the following works:\n\n- control structures\n- operators\n- loops\n- other sequence data types like tuples, lists, dictionaries and sets\n- built in functions\n- list comprehension\n- working with files\n\n***\n\nThere are four steps we need to complete so that we can make this tool work.\n\n1. We can add a basic setup where we can take input from the users and use that input to add expense, view their summary, generate a report or exit the program.\n2. Whatever input we get from the first step, should be saved in a txt file. This way, users can save their new inputs, view their summary and this is where we can get the report.\n3. We build a code that can perform the data analysis and reporting if the user requests to.\n4. Add another option that checks the last 5 transactions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Basic Setup and Data Input\n\n1. We need to build a menu that shows the options that the user can choose from. \n2. Once the user can see these options, they can choose by using the number associated with the option they choose as an input.\n3.
