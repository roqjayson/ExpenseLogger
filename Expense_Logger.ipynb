This tool will help you track expenses, categorize them, and generate basic statistical summaries.\n\nThis tool should allow users to:\n\n1. Input expense data,\n2. Generate summaries and reports, and\n3. Save and load data from files.\n\nIn order for us to build it, we need to know how each of the following works:\n\n- control structures\n- operators\n- loops\n- other sequence data types like tuples, lists, dictionaries and sets\n- built in functions\n- list comprehension\n- working with files\n\n***\n\nThere are four steps we need to complete so that we can make this tool work.\n\n1. We can add a basic setup where we can take input from the users and use that input to add expense, view their summary, generate a report or exit the program.\n2. Whatever input we get from the first step, should be saved in a txt file. This way, users can save their new inputs, view their summary and this is where we can get the report.\n3. We build a code that can perform the data analysis and reporting if the user requests to.\n4. Add another option that checks the last 5 transactions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Basic Setup and Data Input\n\n\n1. We need to build a menu that shows the options that the user can choose from. \n2.
